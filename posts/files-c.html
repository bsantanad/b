        <h1>files in c</h1>
        <p>
            I've been working in python for so long that I have been spoiled on
            how easy things are. I had to write a token detector for a
            compilers class in the last semester of college, and I thought,
            well, I can do it in C, right? I have not used it in a long way.

            But hey, C is one of those things once you've learned, you'll
            always remember? Right?

            Well, apparently not.
        </p>

        <p>
            It seems that I never learned about Files in C or even how to write
            good C at all. I only saw it in my first semesters, where we did
            simple stuff. The homework is due tomorrow, so I wrote a quick
            token detector in python.  Nevertheless, I went to sleep surprised
            about how little I knew about C and how I thought I knew it. So I
            woke up the next day and said, let's write this in C.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a massive book
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Plus-6th-Developers-Library/dp/0321928423">
                C Primer Plus</a>

            that goes into significant depth on the topic, so let's review it
            and write my notes here. This way, my me from the future -- if I
            ever encounter the same problem I had -- can go back here and read
            all about files in c.  Without further say, let's start.
        </p>

        <p>Without further to say, let's start.</p>

        <h2>what is a file?</h2>
        <p>
            Let's start with the basics; a file is just a named storage
            section. C makes the distinction between binary and text files.
            Internally all file content is in binary form; C makes the
            distinction based on if the file primarily uses the binary codes
            for characters that represent text (ASCII or Unicode).
        </p>

        <p>
            C opens 3 files by default when you run a program,
            <code>stdout</code>,<code>stdin</code>, and <code>stderr</code>
            (standard output, standard input, and standard error).  These
            represent your system's regular input, output, and error output.
        </p>

        <h2>simple program</h2>
        <p>let's make a program that counts the characters in a file</p>

<pre><code>/** program that counts the characters in file **/
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        char *prog = argv[0];  /** program name for errors **/

        int c;
        FILE *fp;
        unsigned long count = 0;
        if (argc != 2) {
                printf(&quot;usage: %s filename\n&quot;, prog);
                exit(-1);
        }
        if ((fp = fopen(argv[1], &quot;r&quot;)) == NULL){
                printf(&quot;can not open: %s \n&quot;, argv[1]);
                exit(-1);
        }
        while((c = getc(fp)) != EOF)
        {
                putc(c, stdout);
                count++;
        }

        fclose(fp);
        printf(&quot;file %s has %lu chars\n&quot;, argv[1], count);

        return 0;
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        okay, so what is going on? Let's see.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since we are using args passed in the command line, we use
        <code>*argv[]</code>, which is an array of strings with all the args
        you passed after the binary name.  <code>argv[0]</code> is the name
        of the actual binary. So first, iwe check if the user sent at least two
        params (the binary name and a filename).
    </p>

    <p>
        If he did, we proceed to try and open the file; this is where the
        function <code>fopen</code> comes in handy. Note that it receives two
        args: the filename and how you want to open the file. Since we want to
        read it we used <code>r</code>, but you can also use <code>w</code> for
        writing, <code>a</code> for appending something to the file. If you
        want to see all the options go
        <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fopen.3.html#top_of_page">here</a>,
        or do <code>man fopen</code> in a unix machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        This function will return <code>NULL</code> if the file can not be
        opened. If it works, it will return the FILE pointer to the variable you
        assigned, in this case, <code>fp</code>. A curious fact is that it will
        not point to the actual file in memory; it points to a data object
        containing info about the file.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, then we use <code>getc</code> and <code>putc</code>, this gets
        or puts a char in the specified file. So <code>getc(fp)</code>,
        will get a char from the <code>fp</code> file. And <code>putc(c,
        stdout)</code> will put a char in the standard output (remember that
        those are files also). We do the <code>getc</code> until we get the
        <code>EOF</code> character, this will tell us that the file has ended, so
        we need to stop.

    </p>

    <p>
        Then we use fclose to close the file and call it a day. Note that we
        are using <code>exit()</code> instead of <code>return -1</code> if the
        code fails. This is becuase this function will close all files open by
        the program in case it fails, while return will not.

    </p>

    <h2>simple cat implementation</h2>

<pre><code>/** simple cat implemetation **/
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        char *prog = argv[0]; /** program name for error **/

        char c;
        FILE *fp;

        if (argc &lt; 2){
                printf(&quot;%s: you need to pass at least one file to cat \n&quot;,
                       prog);
                exit(-1);
        }

        /** we need to move the argv array by one, since we dont want to print
         * the binary program, argv[0] = prog (the actual binary) **/
        *argv++;

        while(argc-- &gt; 1){
            if ((fp = fopen(*argv++, &quot;r&quot;)) == NULL) {
                    printf(&quot;%s: can not open file\n&quot;, prog);
                    exit(-1);
            }
            while((c = getc(fp)) != EOF) {
                    putc(c, stdout);
            }
            fclose(fp);
        }
        return 0;
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This basically does the same as the program above, but now we can send
        any number of files to the program, and it will print them to the
        <code>stdout</code> one after the other.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do this is by iterating the <code>argv</code> array, first,
        we skip the first element since it's the actual binary name, and we do
        not want to print that.  Then we iterate thru the following file and
        print it until we are left out of files.

    <p>
        I think that covers the basics of handling files, but probably missing
        something; if so, I'll add it to this post or create a new one. Hope you had a
        TIL moment reading this.
