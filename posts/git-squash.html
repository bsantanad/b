        <h2>squashing commits in git</h2>
        <p>
            We've all been there; you just finished correcting all the typos in
            your README or documentation, made the commit, pushed the changes,
            and then realised you misspelt a word. "Damn," you think "do I
            have to make a new commit for this small change?", "that will only
            make the repo's history bigger and messier". Good thing there
            is a way of fixing this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to squashing commits. I will explain how I do
            it, I don't know if it's the best but it works perfectly for me,
            so it should work for you.
        </p>

        <p>Say you have your history this way:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
9f0fd1c (HEAD -&gt; master) another typo i had not seen
5bc004b typo I missed
78cf95f fixing typos in README
773350e good commit
</code></pre>

    <p>
        The <code>78cf95f</code> is the good one (the one we want to keep),
        <code>5bc004b</code> and <code>9f0fd1c</code> are the ones we want to
        eliminate. Meaning it would be nice that the last two commits could
        be <em>"merged"</em> with <code>78cf95f</code>; this way, we would only
        have one clean and straightforward commit for correcting typos.
    </p>

    <p>
        What do we do? We can use the <code>rebase</code> subcommand to
        <em>squash</em> the other two commits under that one:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase -i 78cf95f^ # please note the ^
</code></pre>

    <p>
        After we run this, a text editor will be open, and this will be
        displayed:
    </p>

<pre><code>pick 78cf95f fixing typos in README
pick 5bc004b typo I missed
pick 9f0fd1c another typo i had not seen

# some comments
</code></pre>

    <p>Then we can squash the commits we want, so:</p>

<pre><code>pick 78cf95f fixing typos in README
squash 5bc004b typo I missed # edit this line
squash 9f0fd1c another typo i had not seen # edit this line

# some comments
</code></pre>

    <p>
        We need to rewrite <code>pick</code> -&gt; <code>squash</code>.
        Then we are good to go; save and quit your text editor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The text editor will be opened again. This time we can modify the
        commit message if we want to add something or remove the message for
        the two commits we are squashing. Once you are happy with the result,
        just save, quit, and voila.
    </p>

<pre><code>$ git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
0335a16 (HEAD -&gt; master) fixing typos in README
773350e good commit
</code></pre>

    <p>
        You now have a single, clean commit. No need to contaminate your
        history with unnecessary commits.
