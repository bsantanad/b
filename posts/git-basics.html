        <h1>a brief introduction to git for solo developers</h1>
    <p>
        I've been using <code>git</code> for a while now, and I know that, at
        first, it can be overwhelming. <code>git</code> is a wild beast; you
        can do much stuff with it. Nevertheless, after using it for a while,
        you'll realise that you won't be using all git capabilities daily, just
        the basic ones. Those are the ones that I'll try to cover in this blog
        post.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will explain how I would have liked to have them explained to
        me when I was starting, but, hey, you are not me, so your mileage may
        vary.
    </p>

    <h2>what is git?</h2>

    <p>
        <code>git</code> is a version control system. This means it will help
        you keep track of the versions of your code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's see an example, say you just finished an assignment for your
        <em>Coding in C</em> class. You are just reviewing the requirements and
        checking all the boxes.  When all of a sudden, you come across one you
        haven't seen before. It is not the end of the world; you realise it's
        just a simple feature that you can add in no time.
    </p>

    <p>
        So you open your favourite text editor and start modifying the code.
        You finish; it looks pretty good. Let's compile it, then. Perfect. Now
        let's test it.  Oops, <em>Segmentation fault (core dumped)</em>. "Damn,"
        you think "is this a new error?", "was this showing up before I made
        the last changes?", "what did I change?", "I did not modify the core
        functionality, did I", "is there a way I can go back in time to when it
        worked?".
    </p>

    <p>
        If this ever happened to you, you "go back in time" by using
        <code>git</code>. <code>git</code> lets us create snapshots of the
        project's current state, meaning we can go back to the state of the
        project where it actually worked or where we had not made something
        stupid.
    </p>

    <p>It will help you a lot, even if you are working alone.</p>

    <h2>using git</h2>

    <p>
    Returning to the example of your <em>C assignment</em>, say you knew how
    to use git before starting to code. So the first step you did was create
    the directory where the code will be placed, <code>cd</code> into it, and
    do:</p>

<pre><code>git init</code></pre>

    <p>
        This will initialise git (if the command is not obvious enough). It
        will create a hidden directory <code>.git</code> but, what happens
        inside there is a story for another day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cool, so now that you have <code>git</code> initialised in your directory,
        you start coding and have the first version you want to keep track
        of, like a good checkpoint if everything goes bananas. How do I
        begin taking snapshots? First, we have to say which files we want to
        keep track of. Say your directory looks like this:
    </p>

<pre><code>.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.c
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.c
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.h
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trash
</code></pre>

    <p>
        We do not want to keep track of the trash file, right? So we will
        <strong>add</strong> the files we want to track with the <code>git
        add</code> command.
    </p>

<pre><code>git add main.c
git add lib.c lib.h
</code></pre>

    <p>
        You can do <code>git status</code> at any time to check what you are
        doing; in this case, it will tell you the following:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        new file:   file.c
        new file:   file.h
        new file:   main.c

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
        trash

</code></pre>

    <p>
        Is the snapshot taken yet? nope. I like to make the analogy of you
        taking copies of a physical document, you go to the copy machine,
        putting the paper in the machine and then pressing the button
        right?Well, we are in the first step of putting the paper to the
        machine. We still have to press the button.
    </p>

    <p>Now let's create the snapshot, then.</p>

<pre><code>git commit -m &quot;first commit&quot;
</code></pre>

    <p>
        We can use the <code>git commit</code> subcommand for that. To be
        honest, I don't like the <code>-m</code> argument, I prefer to do:
    </p>

<pre><code>git commit -vs
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This will sign <code>-s</code> the commit with your name (commit is the
        git name for what we have been referring to as a snapshot), telling
        everyone that you made it (for better or for worse), and will open a
        text editor <code>-v</code>. There you will be able to write the commit
        description.
    </p>

    <p>These descriptions have a title and a body, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>first commit, basic functionality working

main.c and lib.c are linked with the header file, this helps
the functions inside lib.c to be used in main. main.c has ....

# more text

Signed-off-by: dostoyevski crime@punishment.com

# changes done
</code></pre>

    <p>
        This description and title will help anyone who wonders what does that
        commit adds or removes (including you). If you scroll down you can see
        the changes you made.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do <code>git status</code> again you'll just see the trash file:
    </p>

<pre><code>$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
        trash

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>

    <p>
        and if you do <code>git log</code> you'll see the commit you just made
    </p>

<pre><code>$ git log
commit c90ae394e0dd13cfbedddbeb69825d051e4d01ce (HEAD -&gt; master)
Author: dostoyevski crime@punishment.com
Date:   Sat May 14 17:49:34 2022 -0500

    <p>Let's sum up.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>git init</code>: initialise git in a directory
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>git status</code>: check what we are doing with git (the
            state of the repo)
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>git add &lt;somefile&gt;</code>: add a file to the stage env
            (like placing the paper in the copy machine)
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>git commit -vs</code>: take the snapshot, sign it, and
            document it (like pressing the button in the copy machine)
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>git log</code>: check the history of commits (snapshots you
            have taken)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There is one last operation I want to cover in this post, <code>git
            diff</code>; this a helpful subcommand that helps us see what
        has changed from the previous commit to the current state.
    </p>

    <p>
        Say you made your commit and continue working.  Now you have reached
        another milestone in your project, it is a good time to take another
        snapshot.
        You already know the workflow, so you do <code>git add main.c</code>
        then <code>git commit -vs</code> you write the title and body you
        check the history with <code>git log</code>. But what if you want to
        see what you are about to commit? like see the actual changes you
        made to the files. Then you do <code>git diff</code>, it will show you
        in red the lines you removed and in green the ones you added. Pretty
        cool, right?
    </p>

    <p>
         Well, as stated in the title, this is just a brief introduction,
         probably I will write more posts on other git stuff that can help you
         with your workflow; until then, take care.
