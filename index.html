            <p>
                We've all been there, you just finished correcting all the
                typos of your README or documentation, you already made the
                commit, push the changes, and then you realise you misspelled
                a word. "Damn" you think "do I have to make a new commit for
                this small change?", "that will only make the history of the
                repo bigger and messier". Good thing there is a way of fixing
                this...

            <p>
                <p>I've been using <code>git</code> for a while now and I know that it can be
                overwhelming at first. <code>git</code> is wild beast, you can do a lot of stuff with it.
                Nevertheless after using it for a while you'll realise that you wont be using
                all git capabilities on a daily basis, just the basic ones. Those are the ones
                that I'll try to cover in this blog post...</p>

            <small>Feb 28, 2022</small>
            <p>
                I've been working in python for so long that I have been
                spoiled on how easy things are. I had to write a token detector
                for a compilers class in the last semester of college, and I
                thought, well, I can do it in C, right? I have not used it in a
                long way.

                But hey, C is one of those things once you've learned, you'll
                always remember? Right?

                Well, apparently not...
